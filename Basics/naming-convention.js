// --1 Spaces are not allowed in variable names.

// Only letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs are permitted in variable names.

// Case matters when it comes to variable names.

// A letter (alphabet), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($) must be the first character in a variable name, any other special characters must not be taken.

// Certain terms such as reserved words in JavaScript should not be used to name variables.

//--2 A few more conventions for good practices:

// It is good to decide on a case and continue it throughout the code. Example: camelCase. Code looks elegant and proper.

// Name your variable with more than one word. This will verify that the name of your variable is accurate.

// It is suggested not to use variable names that are too short. They do not make proper sense.

var name = "Harsh";
name = "Rakesh";
